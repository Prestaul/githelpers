This repository contains a collection of helper functions and aliases that will hopefully make your git-driven life easier.

First, clone the githelpers repository:
``` bash
git clone git@github.com:Prestaul/githelpers.git ~/githelpers
```

Run the following commands to set up your username and email globally.
After doing so you'll have a .gitconfig file in your home directory:

``` bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
```

Run the following command to allow git to pull our new configuration (provided that you are using git 1.7.10+):

``` bash
git config --global include.path "~/githelpers/gitconfig"
```

Also, update your bash profile (`~/.bash_profile`) to include the init.sh script from this repo:
``` bash
source 'githelpers/init.sh'
```

From there, a really handy way of decorating your prompt is to include the information about the repository that is checked out (eg. which branch, if there are modified files waiting to be staged, if there are staged changes, rebasing/merging status, etc.). The following looks good on a darker background (the color aliases are defined in ```colors```).
``` bash
PS1="${YELLOW}\u@\h ${RESET}\W ${CYAN}\$(__git_ps1 '(%s) ')${RESET}\$ "
```

(if you already have your PS1 set up the way you like it, the important thing in there is to add `${CYAN}\$(__git_ps1 '(%s) ')${RESET}` somewhere inside of it)
